Hi! I'm currently a software engineer at Two Sigma. I received my B.S. and M.Eng. in computer science from MIT in 2022 and 2023, respectively. While there, I was a part of the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/), where I worked with [Tom Silver](https://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/), advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/). I was also fortunate to work on research under [Marin Soljačić](https://www.mit.edu/~soljacic/marin.html) and [Zenna Tavares](https://www.zenna.org/). Previously, I was also a software engineering intern at Two Sigma and at Microsoft.

I am broadly interested in creating intelligent embodied agents that can learn continually in dynamic environments over long time horizons. In my free time, I love running, reading, and playing the violin.

You can contact me at amburger347 at gmail dot com.
