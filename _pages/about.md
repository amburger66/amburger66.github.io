Hi! I'm an incoming first-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my B.S. and M.Eng. in computer science from MIT, where I was a part of the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) and worked with [Tom Silver](https://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/), advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/).

I am broadly interested in creating intelligent embodied agents that can learn and act in dynamic environments over long time horizons. Previously, I was a software engineer at Two Sigma. In my free time, I love running, reading, and [playing the violin](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfGQCSOIWa6aZhP9NAD1B9SD3kxlnOubD&si=L463BKtPUnQUh3A2).
