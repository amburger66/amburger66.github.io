Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in creating intelligent embodied agents that can learn and act in dynamic environments over long time horizons.

Previously I received my B.S. and M.Eng. in computer science from MIT, where I was a part of the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/) and worked with [Tom Silver](https://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/), advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/). I have also spent some time as a software engineer at Two Sigma. In my free time, I love running, reading, and [playing the violin](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfGQCSOIWa6aZhP9NAD1B9SD3kxlnOubD&si=L463BKtPUnQUh3A2).
