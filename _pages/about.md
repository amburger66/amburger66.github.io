Hi! I'm currently a software engineer at Two Sigma. I received my B.S. and M.Eng. in computer science from MIT in 2022 and 2023, respectively. While there, I was a part of the [Learning and Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu/), where I worked with [Tom Silver](https://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/), advised by [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/). I am broadly interested in creating intelligent embodied agents that can learn continually in dynamic environments over long time horizons.

Previously, I was also a software engineering intern at Two Sigma and at Microsoft.
